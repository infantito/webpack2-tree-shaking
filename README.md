* Tree-Shaking: It's the ability to only include code in your bundle that is being used

# Roman Liutikov: 
```
If you wonder why itâ€™s called tree-shaking: think of your application as a dependency graph, this is a tree, and each export is a branch. So if you shake the tree, the dead branches will fall.
